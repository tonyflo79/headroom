"""Model-aware routing with fail-closed cooldowns.

`pick` answers one question: which connected account has PROVEN headroom for
this model family right now? "Proven" means a fresh, identity-bound usage
reading — never a guess. An account is skipped when its reading is missing,
stale, out of range, at 100%, or inside a cooldown from a previous limit-hit.

`run` executes a command on the chosen account and watches its output for
limit errors; on a hit it cools that account down until the relevant window
resets and retries the next candidate.

# --- flock slot leases (opt-in: HEADROOM_SLOT_LEASE=1) ----------------------
#
# At the moment routing COMMITS to an account (just before spawn) the launcher
# takes an exclusive, non-blocking flock() on a per-account lock file and
# holds it for the LIFETIME of the launch. flock is race-free by construction
# (the kernel arbitrates; there is no read/decide/write TOCTOU and no stale
# file to delete) and is released automatically when the last holding process
# dies — so a crash frees the slot and there is no pid to reuse. On the exec
# path the locked fd is made inheritable and survives execvp, so the CLI holds
# the lease for its own lifetime; on the supervised path the resident
# supervisor holds it and MOVES it to the active account across an automatic
# handoff (acquire target before stopping source; release source after the
# target child spawns).
#
# A candidate account is unavailable iff a non-blocking flock probe fails
# (another live launch holds it). The flock is authoritative — acquire
# re-checks it atomically — so the probe in block_reason is only a hint: a
# probe error degrades to "not blocked" and can never crash routing.
# Acquisition, by contrast, FAILS CLOSED: when leasing is requested but the
# lock cannot be operated for an infrastructure reason, routing raises
# LeaseError and the launch refuses rather than double-booking one account.
