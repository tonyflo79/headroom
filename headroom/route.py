"""Model-aware routing with fail-closed cooldowns.

`pick` answers one question: which connected account has PROVEN headroom for
this model family right now? "Proven" means a fresh, identity-bound usage
reading — never a guess. An account is skipped when its reading is missing,
stale, out of range, at 100%, or inside a cooldown from a previous limit-hit.

`run` executes a command on the chosen account and watches its output for
limit errors; on a hit it cools that account down until the relevant window
resets and retries the next candidate.
